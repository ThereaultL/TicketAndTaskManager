# TicketAndTaskManager
**Author:** Lillian Thereault<br>
**Version:** May 2025<br><br>

**Description**<br>
The goal of this project is to simulate a simplified version of tools like Jira or Trello, where users can submit and manage “tickets” (issues, bugs, tasks) in a collaborative environment.<br>
Users can view a list of current tickets (bugs or tasks), add a new ticket with details like title, description, status, and priority, edit or update existing tickets, and delete tickets.
