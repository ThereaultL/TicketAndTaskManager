# TicketAndTaskManager
The goal of this project is to simulate a simplified version of tools like Jira or Trello, where users can submit and manage “tickets” (issues, bugs, tasks) in a local environment.<br>
Users can view a list of current tickets, add a new ticket with details like title, description, status, edit or update existing tickets, and resolve/delete tickets.
